# Precise Control

This script polls two gamepad controllers (XBOX 360) and converts movements on the axis to keypresses.
The aim of the script is to obtain higher precision by simulating slow key presses when an axis is pushed little and fast key presses when an axis is fully engaged.

I wrote this tool to be able to play the free tetris clone [Cultris II](http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx) with two people.

### Prerequisites
